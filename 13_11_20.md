# Week 13/11/20

This week I mostly worked on the acute medical unit. I saw a lot of covid, dka, heart failure, and stroke. I had a good team and was impressed by how quickly specialist support from
other teams was available. Happily, it felt like a very well run unit. 

I got another login. This time for datix which our incident management system. I'm the mortality and morbidity lead for my department and the datix system is where pointers
to all of the things that I have to review to determine if there's anything that can be learned live. The work involves requesting and reviewing the paper notes then
updating the incident log in datix. Periodically, departmental reviews are presented to the hospital mortality and morbidity meeting. I attended one this week. I thought
a bit about how rarely there's genuine learning that is actionable to improve the system / a systems fix. As a side project I've decided to automagically compile all of the health 
related preventable deaths from [coroners investigations](https://www.judiciary.uk/subject/prevention-of-future-deaths/).

Also this week I did some job planning and began to think about how best to develop our asthma / occupational lung disease / sarcoid services, which will hopefully be within my 
official remit once my job plan is approved.
