# Week 25/09/20

This week I added respiratory ward cover to TB and general respiratory clinics and bronchoscopy, got my very own dictaphone, met the trust CCIO, and helped out by post-taking a few AMU patients for good measure. 

Nearly half of my inpatients have covid (ours is the dedicated covid ward) so I brushed up on the management of covid (largely supportive care +/- steroids and anticoagulation). I enjoyed thinking about why a young person might have a stroke and making sure we did a thorough workup and why a frail elderly patient with vascular dementia probably didn't need an inpatient MRI. The ward team are great and the covid SHO who came to make sure our covid patients are enrolled in the RECOVERY trial was most welcome.

I heard that the program we use to see patients' previous medical history, CIP, has to logout every 300 seconds (wasting an inordinate amount of clinical time) because to fix it would require a prohibitively expensive change request and the software is due to be replaced soon - in March 2021! 

It was valuable to me to speak with our CCIO who most generously met with me. My view on what should be done is very different to his (I'm conscious I have much less experience). I appear to be very out of kilter as far as mainstream NHS IT strategy goes. He suggested that my risk appetite is greater than most but I don't think that's true; I think the status quo is unacceptably bad and have no appetite for the risk of perpetuating it that continuing to do the same brings. He kindly sent me some slide decks on end-user acceptance of enterprise IT / how important training is that I think are not quite right; I'll try and articulate why in more detail, and continue the conversation, another time.
