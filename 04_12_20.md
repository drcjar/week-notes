# Week 04/12/20

Last week was busy with ward, clinic, bronch, and teaching. I got access to another new system, allocate, which is used for job planning. I did a course on being
an educational and clinical supervisor and met with my first trainee.

This week I've been working from home and mostly doing clinics and admin. I've a nice home working set up now which involves nested remote desktops for reasons... 

No news on my academic paper. Have got all the data to hand now for a side project looking at preventing future death reports (the easy bit) now to look at in a
helpful/interesting way (the much harder bit). Next week is much needed a/l.
