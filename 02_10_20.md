# Week 02/10/20

This week I mostly looked after my ward patients. I had the same excellent team as I've had the last couple of weeks and all went smoothly. I had an interesting 
TB vs sarcoidosis case that I picked up from the MDT and revisited that sarcoidosis is a more common cause of the BHL than TB, and that necrotising granulomas can be
present in sarcoidosis. I felt grateful for uptodate and for having friendly experienced colleagues to sanity check my plans. 

I've been working on a COVID19 ARDS NIV plan/guideline for my trust and have seen that we still don't really know whether or not NIV is helpful in COVID19 ARDS wrt 
making people live longer. To my mind we would ideally therefore not be using it outside of an RCT so that we find out. 

Several nice things happened, a consultant colleague came to find me to tell me he liked a clinic letter of mine, I had my PhD minor corrections accepted, I had a
review article accepted, and I had a winter BTS abstract accepted, and much chasing I recieved my first consultant paycheck on time. Onwards!
