# Week 18/09/20

This week I started working as a locum NHS consultant in respiratory and general internal medicine at North Middlesex University Hospital. I met my medical colleagues, service managers, secretaries, outpatient staff, occupational health, HR, security and IT. 

Everyone was friendly and I got occupational health clearance, an ID card, door access codes for the consultant office, secretary office, rest room, and storage room, computer access, access to medway live (for seeing where patients are and their test results), CIP (for seeing letters about patients and test results), PACS (for seeing xrays etc of patients), and dictate.it (for dictating letters about patients I've seen). I applied for a secure bicycle parking space. I tried to apply for remote access but couldn't find a way and heard there's a 'dongle' shortage.

I did two clinics and saw, arranged things, and wrote letters for 11 patients. I attended one imaging MDT and two bronchoscopy lists. I did one EBUS. I attended one departmental business meeting where we discussed that all of the respiratory consultants sharing one office is potentially suboptimal in terms of pandemic preparedness and resiliance. I raised two IT helpdesk issues 1. I reported a computer that took about 15 minutes to start. 2. I requested that CIP not automatically logout after 300 seconds because it's quite time consuming to have to log in to it every 20 minutes. 

I learned about eosinophilc granulomatous polyangitis and reminded myself of the american college of rheumatology diagnostic criteria that are 4 of the following six: asthma, nasal symptoms, transient pulmonary infiltrates, peripheral eospinophila, mononeuritis multiplex, and a biopsy showing accumulation of eosinophils outside of blood vessels. And of the typical MPO ANCA positivity.  

Other things I did this week included getting signed off as having finished my respiratory training. Asking to be signed off as having finished my general internal medicine training. And, on the academic front, waiting to hear if my PhD minor corrections got accepted or not, waiting to get my coauthors edits/comments/rewrites of my PhD paper, and setting up meetings to discuss those sort of things.

I felt a bit sad about having to wait for over an hour for my occupational health appointment only to be told that acutally I didn't need to be seen. I felt a bit sad about all of the application forms for access to things being paper based; I don't like writing my name etc lots of times on different pieces of paper for what seems like no good reason. I felt a bit sad about the IT issues and response so far.

I felt very happy with my colleagues and with my clinic, I had time to prepare well for it and it went smoothly. I feel really happy to be a consultant and am looking forward to being the ward consultant next week for the first time. I like living close to work and cycling. This week work/life balance felt good.
