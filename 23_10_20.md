This week I looked after ward patients, saw clinic patients, did an evening post take ward round, and a consultant interview.

I saw some challenging cases including a younger person with very bad emphysema which made me think about smoking, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, cadmium fume exposure, and lung transplant. Relately, lung function testing should soon be available again
locally as our plans for restarting the service during the pandemic were confirmed. 

I thought about how difficult chronic cough management is to do well; a colleague who has recently retired ran a busy cough service and I've seen a few of his patients in clinic. Intractable cough is life-changing for patients and failure to get to the bottom of why its happening and to control the symptom is dispiriting for everyone. 

I did an interview for a substantive consultant post and very happily was successful! The interview didn't go as well as I would have liked; I didn't have much time to prepare and was quite tired but I did get some helpful feedback after so that's good. Below are my notes which I'll stick up with other [medical notes](http://carlreynolds.net/category/medicine.html) at some point.
