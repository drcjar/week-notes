# Week 24/12/23

Is it still week notes if there's a three year hiatus? It seem crazy that the last time I wrote to myself was three years ago. My mum died, my children no longer go to nursery, I've a dog, I got my [phd paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9887381/) over the line, and another [paper](https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/early/2023/03/03/13993003.01585-2022I), I did [deathlessons](http://deathlessons.org/?q=) with a friend, ran the london marathon (and started running generally), and I changed jobs a few times.. North Mid Resp Cons -> North Mid Resp Cons + CCIO/CMIO + NHSRHO clinical adviser -> Imperial Resp Cons + NHSRHO clinical adviser.
