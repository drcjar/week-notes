This week I welcomed two new locum consultant colleagues which was nice. It was my third week as a ward consultant and together with my clinics (and some
spectacularly slow and fiddly clincial information systems.. seriously thinking about buying some extra ram for my work computer myself) it felt a struggle 
to keep on top of my accumulating clinical admin. Better catch up next week.

I got access to careflow connect which is a nice patient list as a web service reminiscent of [elcid](https://elcid.openhealthcare.org.uk/) but without the ability
to view results or obs etc, I think (and hope) that's coming soon.

Lots of uncertainty at work with job planning etc in the time of COVID. Should finally finish and submit a paper from my [PhD](http://carlreynolds.net/ipfjes-thesis/)
next week.
