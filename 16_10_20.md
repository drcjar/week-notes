# Week 16/10/20

I caught up on my clinical admin and as far as I know nothing bad happened to anyone, hurrah!

I also felt very excited to order an unofficial ram upgrade for my computer. Could be the start of a clandestine campaign to make the computers
at work work. Naturally my week notes are now a work of fiction. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events, is purely coincidental.

In other news my phd paper edged towards but did not yet quite cross the finish line of submission. I remain genuinely in awe of how quickly some of my
collaborators can rattle through, and solidly review and critique work, that I send to them. Submission feels so close now. Maybe next week? 

Next week brings an interview for a substantive consultant post (I'm currently a locum) I'd really like... unless of course it gets bumped by covid which seems a 
real possibility.... Fingers crossed it doesn't get bumped and we keep on top of scaling up our covid response. Onwards.
