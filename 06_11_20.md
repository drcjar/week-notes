# Week 06/11/20

Refreshed from a fun packed half term and a bit with my daughter this week I looked after ward patients, a general respiratory clinic, and a lot of admin.

I finally managed to get remote access up which is a three stage process... First step involves getting setup for two-factor authentication by means of a special
corporate magic token generating phone app that requires a password to view the token and was non-trivial to set up. Hopefully SafeNet MobilePASS+ app is more secure than the much easier and widely used
google authenticator app... Second step is installing a proprietary cisco anyconnect vpn wrapper ('Redcentric Anyconnect'). Third step is installing a citrix workspace. I think the
secret vpn settings in recentric anyconnect will make it a faff to run on a linux box which is a shame. Overall, all of the things seem to work much better (much faster,
more responsive, consequently more usable) when accessed remotely rather than by using the computers in the hospital. Probably because the virtual machine is spec'd
much better than the poor 4gb of ram computers in the hospital (n.b adding 4gb to one such computer cost Â£20 and made an enormous difference to performance). Still
haven't heard back from the IT helpdesk regarding my report of this issue a few weeks ago. Am chasing.

I thought about the safe discharge of patients with hyperglycaemia; probably well worth reading about given I look after covid patients and we give most of them
steroids. This joint british diabetes societies came to the rescue with a useful [recap]( https://www.diabetes.org.uk/resources-s3/2017-09/JBDS%20management%20of%20hyperglycaemia%20and%20steriod%20therapy_0.pdf)
that mostly confirmed what I thought; steroid induced hyperglycaemia usually gets better but may be unmasking of TII DM instead. Monitoring BMs +/- initiating
an anti-hyperglycaemic like metformin and gp f/u is a reasonable tack.

Outpatient blood tests were a problem again. From time to time I need to arrange blood tests for outpatients. At present the workflow for this is request electronically
then ask them to attend the outpatients dept or see the respiratory secretary who then books them a phlebotomy slot. Then they go to phlebotomy dept and have their
blood taken. I previously had a pt who told me they were turned away from phlebotomy (sent home!) when they attended phlebotomy directly. In my opinion there's a
clear service design issue here. The most obvious thing would be for patients to go directly to phlebotomy when a test has been requested electronically. Non-obvious
workarounds are a struggle for clinicians and patients alike. I'll try and check my understanding of this and see if it can be improved in the coming weeks.

Another process thing is clinic appointments. Patients often need to be followed up in clinic when they're discharged from the ward. My understanding is that this is
usually, but not always, booked by the ward clerk, or the consultant's secretary... I've reviewed all of my discharges so far and about a third seem not to
have had appointments made yet. I'll be sure to find out why and fix and will continue to monitor.

This week I also had chance to read a friends lung cancer [paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32803172/) exploring how tumor mutation burden affects the immune
response (t-cells in particular), and I had a paper come out in [clinics in chest medicine](https://www.chestmed.theclinics.com/current), probably a paywall and
elsevier appears to have formatted it horribly. Still didn't finish my phd paper, but it's getting v close now! I also thought about job planning and research
spas.

Next week brings AMU, until then.
