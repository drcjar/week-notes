# Week 20/11/20

This week I finally submitted a paper I've been working on for a while to the blue journal. Fingers crossed. I made some progress on a fun side project looking at preventing
future deaths coroner reports. I learned how to use datix for mortality and morbidity reviews. I met with the trust R&D lead, CMIO, and deputy medical director. 

Next week it's learnign to be an educational supervisor, ward, and clinic. Onwards!
